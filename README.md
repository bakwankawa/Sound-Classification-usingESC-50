# Sound-Classification-usingESC-50
A task from campus to do 1D sound classification.  
* In this project im using ESC-50 Dataset.
* Because the data train in this dataset  only consist 2000, im doing data augmentation with gaussian noise using pseudorandom generator.
* Convert to spectogram before trained in CNN.
* The model use feature matching to classify the sound class, and got 85% accuracy in new data test.
